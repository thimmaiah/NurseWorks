Feature: Shift Closing
  Ensure  a shift is closed properly

Scenario Outline: Close Shift
  
  Given there is a hospital "verified=true" with me as admin "role=Admin"
  Given there is a request "<request>"
  Given there is a user "<user>"
  Given the nurse is mapped to the hospital
  And the user has already accepted this request
  Given jobs are being dispatched
  Then the user receives an email with "Shift Confirmed" in the subject
  And when the user enters the start and end code
  Given jobs are being dispatched
  Then the shift price is computed and stored
  Then the payment for the shift is generated
  Then the shift is marked as closed
  And the request is marked as closed 
  
  Examples:
  	|request	                         | user                            |
  	|role=Nurse                     |role=Nurse;verified=true    |
  	|role=Nurse;speciality=Generalist    |role=Nurse;verified=true         |
    |role=Nurse;speciality=Generalist    |role=Nurse;speciality=Pediatric Care;verified=true|



Scenario Outline: Add Start Code
  
  Given there is a hospital "verified=true" with me as admin "role=Admin"
  Given there is a request "<request>"
  Given there is a user "<user>"
  Given the nurse is mapped to the hospital
  And the user has already accepted this request
  Given the user is logged in 
  And when the user enters the "start_code" "<start_code>" in the UI
  Then he must see the message "<msg>"
  Given jobs are being dispatched
  
  Examples:
    |request                          | user                            | start_code  |  msg            |
    |role=Nurse;start_code=1111  |role=Nurse;verified=true    | 1111        | 1111   |
    |role=Nurse;start_code=1112       |role=Nurse;verified=true         | 1112        | 1112   |

Scenario Outline: Add Start Code No Match
  
  Given there is a hospital "verified=true" with me as admin "role=Admin"
  Given there is a request "<request>"
  Given there is a user "<user>"
  Given the nurse is mapped to the hospital
  And the user has already accepted this request
  Given the user is logged in 
  And when the user enters the "start_code" "<start_code>" in the UI
  Then he must see the message "<msg>"

  Examples:
    |request                          | user                            | start_code  |  msg            |
    |role=Nurse;start_code=1113       |role=Nurse;verified=true         | 1111        | Start Code does not match|


Scenario Outline: QR Code entered
  
  Given there is a hospital "verified=true;qr_code=123" with me as admin "role=Admin"
  Given there is a request "<request>"
  Given the request can be started now
  Given there is a user "<user>"
  Given the nurse is mapped to the hospital
  And the user has already accepted this request
  Given the user scans the QR code 
  Then the shift is started
  Given jobs are being dispatched
  Given the user scans the QR code 
  Then the shift is ended
  Given jobs are being dispatched
  
  Examples:
    |request                                | user                            |
    |role=Nurse;start_code=1113             |role=Nurse;verified=true         |
    |role=Nurse;start_code=1114        |role=Nurse;verified=true         |

Scenario Outline: Wrong QR Code entered
  
  Given there is a hospital "verified=true;qr_code=123" with me as admin "role=Admin"
  Given there is a request "<request>"
  Given the request can be started now
  Given there is a user "<user>"
  Given the nurse is mapped to the hospital
  And the user has already accepted this request
  Given the user scans the wrong QR code 
  Then the shift is not started
  
  Examples:
    |request                                | user                            |
    |role=Nurse;start_code=1113             |role=Nurse;verified=true         |
    |role=Nurse;start_code=1114        |role=Nurse;verified=true         |


Scenario Outline: Add End Code
  
  Given there is a hospital "verified=true" with me as admin "role=Admin"
  Given there is a request "<request>"
  Given there is a user "<user>"
  Given the nurse is mapped to the hospital
  And the user has already accepted this request
  And the shift has a valid start code
  Given the user is logged in 
  And when the user enters the "end_code" "<end_code>" in the UI
  Then he must see the message "<msg>"
  Given jobs are being dispatched
  Then the markup should be computed
  Then the total price should be computed  
  
  Examples:
    |request                        | user                            | end_code  |  msg            |
    |role=Nurse;end_code=1111  |role=Nurse;verified=true    | 1111      | 1111   |
    |role=Nurse;end_code=1112       |role=Nurse;verified=true         | 1112      | 1112   |


Scenario Outline: Add End Code No Match
  
  Given there is a hospital "verified=true" with me as admin "role=Admin"
  Given there is a request "<request>"
  Given there is a user "<user>"
  Given the nurse is mapped to the hospital
  And the user has already accepted this request
  And the shift has a valid start code
  Given the user is logged in 
  And when the user enters the "end_code" "<end_code>" in the UI
  Then he must see the message "<msg>"

  Examples:
    |request                        | user                            | end_code  |  msg            |
    |role=Nurse;end_code=1113       |role=Nurse;verified=true         | 1111      | End Code does not match|


Scenario Outline: Cancel Accepted Shift
  
  Given there is a hospital "verified=true" with an admin "role=Admin"
  Given there is a request "<request>"
  Given there is a user "<user>"
  Given the nurse is mapped to the hospital
  And the user has already accepted this request
  Given jobs are being dispatched
  Given Im logged in 
  And I cancel the shift
  Then the shift must be cancelled
  Given jobs are being dispatched
  Then the care giver receives an email with "Shift Cancelled" in the subject
  Then the requestor receives an email with "Shift Cancelled" in the subject

  Examples:
    |request                          | user                            | start_code  |  msg            |
